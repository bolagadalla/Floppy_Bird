# Flappy Bird Clone
This was one of my first try on making a game in Unity. I followed a tutorial on YouTube that went step by step to make the game. I followed those steps to make this Flappy Bird clone. I knew C# at that point, but I learned a lot from this tutorial to say the least.

## What I Learned:
	-[x] Unity's Interface
	-[x] Creating folders and files
	-[x] Importing assets
	-[x] Creating Prefabs
	-[x] Writing game logic
	-[x] Export the game
